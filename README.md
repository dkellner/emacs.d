## Introduction ##

*I love Emacs*. For me, `(emacs-uptime)` almost equals `uptime`, which I
consider a good thing. As for most Emacs users, my configuration changed
over time and adapted to new languages, habits and quirks and will most
likely continue to do so.

This repository came to be because I myself like to browse other Emacs
configurations for inspiration.


## A note about keybindings ##

Some keybindings may look strange to you. The reason might be that I am using
Neo2 ([neo-layout.org](http://neo-layout.org/index_en.html)).
